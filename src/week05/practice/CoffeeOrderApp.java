Create a class named CoffeeOrderApp with the following variables:
        - blackCoffeePrice: the price of black coffee
        - lattePrice: the price of a latte
        - cappuccinoPrice: the price of a cappuccino
        - totalPrice: the total cost of the user's order
    Create a straightforward coffee ordering application with these steps:
        Step 1. Ask the user if they want to order coffee.
            	Welcome to the Coffee Order App!
            Would you like to order coffee?
            If they say "yes", proceed to step #2. If they say "no," display "Thanks for using our service!"
            For any other response, end the application with the error message "Invalid answer, please try again later!"
        Step 2. Display the coffee options on the console:
            Coffee Options:
                1. Black Coffee - $blackCoffeePrice
                2. Latte - $lattePrice
                3. Cappuccino - $cappuccinoPrice
        Step 3. Ask the user to pick a coffee:
            3.1 If they choose 1, display "Added Black Coffee to Your Order."
            3.2 If they choose 2, display "Added Latte to Your Order."
            3.3 If they choose 3, display "Added Cappuccino to Your Order."
            3.4 If their choice is invalid, end the application with the error message "Invalid choice, please try again later!"
        Step 4. Ask if they want another order:
            If they say "yes," repeat from step #2.
            If they say "no," display the total cost of their order: "Your total is: $total."
            For any other response, end the application with the error message "Invalid answer, please try again later!"
